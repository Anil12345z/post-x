# post-x
Post-x is an API platform for using and testing APIs like postman but with limited features.
this is very simple project with html , css and javascript in which fetach Api used for testing the API.

There are 4 methods of API -
1.HTTP GET
Use GET requests to retrieve resource representation/information only – and not modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change the resource’s state, these are said to be safe methods.
2. HTTP POST
Use POST APIs to create new subordinate resources, e.g., a file is subordinate to a directory containing it or a row is subordinate to a database table.
3.HTTP PUT
Use PUT APIs primarily to update an existing resource (if the resource does not exist, then API may decide to create a new resource or not).
4.HTTP DELETE
As the name applies, DELETE APIs delete the resources (identified by the Request-URI).
DELETE operations are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it’s removed from the collection of resources.

What are API Headers?
API headers are like an extra source of information for each API call you make. Their job is to represent the meta-data associated with an API request and response.

If you ever encounter issues with an API, the first place you should look is the headers, since they can help you track down any potential issues. This makes them a very important part of each request.

API Headers tell you about:

1.Request and Response Body
2.Request Authorization
3.Response Caching
4.Response Cookies

Auth and params.
